## What is stock price prediction?
It is the method of analyzing the past data of a specific stock in order to predict the future price for it.

In this repo, I used Python with RNN(LSTM) model to predict Tesla stock price, hoping that I can make Elon Musk happy along the way. 

Please consider reading [my tutorial](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/stock-price-prediction-using-python/) if you want to follow along with this code.
